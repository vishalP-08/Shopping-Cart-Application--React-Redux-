Shopping Cart using React Redux : 

1. Make a real life shopping cart application where there are 2 pages - First is the home page where you fetch a list of products from an api and the products are displayed. The second page is the my cart Page.

2. The goal is to accomplish the cart functionality using redux. So make a redux state for your cart and make a redux state of all the products that you get from the API.
